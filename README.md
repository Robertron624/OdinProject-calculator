# Vanilla javascript calculator

## Description

This is a simple calculator made with vanilla javascript, html and css.

## How to use

Just clone the repository and open the index.html file in your browser.

You can edit the javascript code in the `script.js` file, but run the command
`npm run terser` to minify the code before pushing to github.

The javascript linked in the html file is the minified version located in `./dist/script.min.js`.
